# Introduction to Whirlwind

Whirlwind is a statically-typed, imperative, compiled language
built to bridge the gap between hardcore systems languages
such as C++ and extremely dynamic, data science languages such as Python.

This guide will:

- Teach you the basics of programming in Whirlwind.
- Familiarize you with your compiler.
- Introduce you to important packages in the Standard Library.
- Demonstrate best practices and good style in Whirlwind.

This guide is **NOT** anywhere close to comprehensive.  There are
a number of critical topics that are not discussed and even more
that are only examined at a surface level.  If you want to get a more
complete look at the language, start by reading through (as best you can)
the language specification and trying out our Whirlwind Koans.

## Some Interesting Quirks

There are couple of things that make Whirlwind stand out from other
languages.  The first and most obvious example is Whirlwind's unique
type system that allows you to create types in numerous different
ways from enumerated types, structs, aliases, and even more complex
types beyond that.  To compound that, Whirlwind takes a much more flexible
approach to the idea methods allowing for methods to bound onto any type
creating a much more unique method of "object orientation".
Another important distinction are the functional aspects of Whirlwind.  
While it is primarily an imperative language as stated before,
it supports a number of functional programming techniques including but not limited to
closures, comprehensions, partial functions (the good kind), chaining, and an inline case statement.  
We also provide an entire package dedicated to giving you a powerful, yet
simple functional toolkit.  In addition to a functional toolkit, we also provide
a simple, but adaptable concurrency model that ships with several standard
constructs and paradigms such as an event system, mutexes, thread managers, and more.

## Finally...

Now that you have a good idea just what your getting into, I wish you the best of luck on
your adventures with Whirlwind and hope that you will stick around long enough to really
appreciate it.  While it certainly isn't a perfect language, it does provide a very
versatile and powerful toolkit that can enhance any programmers experience.  Additionally,
once mastered, Whirlwind is actually fairly intuitive and can be written exceptionally
quickly.  Although it may be difficult at first, once you get into it, I firmly believe that
you will really enjoy it.

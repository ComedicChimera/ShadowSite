<h1>Pattern Maching</h1>
<p><strong>Pattern matching</strong> is a mechanism for efficiently extracting the values of
more complex data structures.  It can also be used to create extremely efficient
control flow.</p>
<h2>Tuples</h2>
<p>A <strong>tuple</strong> is a fixed-length, ordered grouping of data.  It stores multiple
elements of different types in specific positions.  </p>
<p>You can create a tuple by enclosing a sequence of values separated by commas in
parentheses.</p>
<pre><code>let pair = (1, 2)
</code></pre>
<p><code>pair</code> is a tuple of two integers.  Here are some other examples of tuples:</p>
<pre><code>("abc", 3)
(3.14, 2.718, 1.414)
('q', 0, 'r', 1)
</code></pre>
<p>The type label of a tuple is structured similarly to its literal value. It is a
sequence of type labels enclosed in parentheses.  For example, the type label
for pair would be <code>(int, int)</code>.  </p>
<p>You can access the elements of tuples using a <code>.</code> followed by the <strong>index</strong> of
the element in the tuple.  Tuples are zero indexed so to get the first element,
you would use the index <code>0</code>. </p>
<pre><code>let first = pair.0
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>This style of accessing is unique to tuples -- a more standard syntax is used
for collections.  However, in Whirlwind, tuples are treated more like data
structures than like collections of values.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note that the indices must be constant integer values.  You cannot use an
expression or variable to access a tuple since the compiler would not know the
type of the value being accessed.</p>
<p>Finally, it is impossible to change the fields of a tuple individually once it
has been created.</p>
<pre><code>pair.0 = 4 # ERROR
</code></pre>
<h2>Tuple Deconstruction</h2>
<p><strong>Tuple deconstruction</strong> (also called tuple unpacking) is the first kind of
pattern matching that we will look at in this chapter.  Tuple deconstruction is
a kind of pattern matching used to access the elements of the tuple without
having to resort to the <code>.</code> syntax every time.  </p>
<p>We can use tuple deconstruction to unpack the elements of the tuple into
variables. Let's see what this looks like in practice:</p>
<pre><code>let (x, y) = pair
</code></pre>
<p>The variables <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> will now hold the values in their corresponding
positions <code>pair</code>.  Notice that the pattern of variables of the left side of the
initializer matches up with the pattern of values on the right side.  This is
where the term pattern matching comes from.</p>
<p>We can also use pattern matching in assignment.</p>
<pre><code>let
    triple1 = (1, 2, 0),
    triple2 = (0, 5, 6)

let (x, y, z) = triple1

# -- snip --

x, y, z = triple2
</code></pre>
<p>If we don't want to extract all the values of a tuple and or don't care about
all of them, we can use the special variable <code>_</code> to ignore values during pattern
matching.</p>
<pre><code>a, _, b = triple2
</code></pre>
<p>Both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> will be populate with their corresponding tuple values.
However, the middle value is simply ignored. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>You cannot use <code>_</code> as a variable nor can you access it as a value.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Match Expression</h2>
<p>The <strong>match expression</strong> is a control flow expression used to facilitate
sophisticated pattern matching in expressions.  It is begun with the <code>match</code>
keyword, followed by an argument, the <code>to</code> keyword, and series of cases to match
against.</p>
<p>The cases are made up of a pattern and an expression separated by the <code>-&gt;</code>
operator.  Let's see what this expression looks like so we can break it down a
bit more.</p>
<pre><code>let v = (1, 1)

let is_std_basis = match v to
    (1, 0) -&gt; true
    (0, 1) -&gt; true
    _ -&gt; false
</code></pre>
<p><code>v</code> is our argument and match statement compares it to several different values
to see if it matches.  This introduces us to an aspect of pattern matching not
present before: value matching.  The pattern matching mechanism will also allows
us to compare values directly. </p>
<p>Notice that the match expression ends with <code>_ -&gt; false</code>.  This is a special case
called the <strong>default case</strong> -- the variable <code>_</code> in pattern matching will match
any value and ignore it (somewhat similar to what it does in tuple
deconstruction).  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This case is provided to make the match expression exhaustive.  Like if
expressions, a match expression that is not will yield an Option type.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, notice that the branches of this expression all yield values of
the same type.  This is another part of the match statement: all the branches
must yield values equal or coercible to the same type.</p>
<p>We can put multiple patterns in one branch -- so to shorten the sample code
above, we could write:</p>
<pre><code>let is_std_basis = match v to
    (1, 0), (0, 1) -&gt; true
    _ -&gt; false
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we separated the patterns with commas.  Now either pattern will
yield the same branch.</p>
<p>We can elso extract values into variables while we are matching cases.</p>
<pre><code>let expr = ("add", 1, 2)

let result = match expr to
    ("add", a, b) -&gt; a + b
    ("mul", a, b) -&gt; a * b
    (_, a, _) -&gt; a
</code></pre>
<p>Each branch extracts the values it needs from the tuple to perform the calculate
while simultanously checking a condition.  Notice that we didn't use the default
case at the end because the match expression was already exhaustive: the last
case always matches if none of the others do.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you extract named values, you cannot use multiple patterns in one branch.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Fallthrough Statements</h2>
<p>Match expressions can contain blocks on their branches, like if expressions.</p>
<pre><code>let message = ("greet", "Carl")

match message to
    ("greet", name) do
        println("Hello there,", name)
    ("goodbye", name) do
        println("Goodbye,", name)
    ("birthday", name) do
        println("Happy Birthday,", name)
    _ do
        println("Unable to display message.")
</code></pre>
<p>If you are coming from another language, you may be used to <code>break</code> being
required at the end of match case branches (often called switch statements in
other languages).  In Chai, this is not only not required but also not
permitted. The <code>break</code> statement is reserved exclusively for exiting loops and
will work to that end even if placed at the end of a match statement.</p>
<p>To replace the fallthrough behavior of the conventional switch statement, Chai
introduces a <code>fallthrough</code> statement that can be used anywhere inside a case to
automatically jump to the next one.</p>
<pre><code>let n = 5

match n to
    0 do
        println("Additive identity and")
        fallthrough
    2 do
        println("Even")
    1 do
        println("Multiplicative identity and")
        fallthrough
    3, 5 do
        println("Odd and prime")
</code></pre>
<p>When using <code>fallthrough</code>, the next case may not extract a named value in its
pattern.  You may also notice that our last cases matches multiple values: <code>3</code>
and <code>5</code>.  This behavior works identically to the equivalent in match
expressions, and, once again, both patterns may not extract values.</p>
<h2>Test-Match Expressions</h2>
<p><strong>Test-Match expressions</strong> are special expressions used to test if a value
matches a given pattern and to extract values from that pattern.  It is written
in the following form:</p>
<pre><code>expr match pattern
</code></pre>
<p>It returns <code>true</code> if the <code>expr</code> matches the pattern and <code>false</code> if it doesn't.</p>
<pre><code>let t = (2, 3, 4)

println(t match (2, _, 4))  # =&gt; true
</code></pre>
<p>You can also use the test-match expression to extract variables.</p>
<pre><code>if t match (2, _, x) do
    println(x)
</code></pre>
<p>Note that this is best used in if expressions like so -- <code>x</code> cannot be accessed
outside of the sub-block it is declared in.</p>

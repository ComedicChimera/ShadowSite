<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>In this tutorial, we are going to teach you about the fundamentals of the
language.  This tutorial is designed for breadth, not depth: to cover everything
you need to know to get started and to act as a resource for new Chai developers
as they get started.</p>
<p>This guide assumes a basic knowledge of programming -- familiarity with the idea
of a variable, function, etc. -- and some experience using the command-line (in
general).  Everything to do with the Chai toolchain that is necessary for this
guide will be taught in the next section.</p>
<h2>Using This Tutorial</h2>
<p>As you read through the tutorial, we strongly encourage you to play around with
some of the example code, especially that which doesn't make sense to you.  It
is a very good idea to have a Chai program file open that you can copy and paste
code into and a terminal open to run your working file.  This should give you a
space to explore the language as you learn it and help cement your understanding
of it.</p>
<p>Although this tutorial will help you get started, to actually learn the
language, you will need to <em>use</em> it.  As you work through the tutorial, try
making some toy programs -- more than just copying example code -- that uses
what you have learned.  When you finish with this tutorial, try to work on a
<em>small</em> project that uses Chai so you can get a sense of how the language works
in a real world context and build your "muscle memory" of the language.</p>
<h2>Other Resources</h2>
<p>This guide, while helpful, is not the be all, end all of Chai programming
resources.  As such, there are some other resources that may be helpful both in
learning the language and as documentation for future use.</p>
<h3>Language Specification</h3>
<p>This is a fairly hefty and dry read, but it is the definitive resource for all
things Chai: every language feature is documented and specified here.</p>
<h3>Standard Library Reference</h3>
<p>This is hosted on Chai's package index and documents all of the standard library
functions of the language.</p>
<h3>Style Guide</h3>
<p>This documents standard conventions of the language including naming, comments,
and more.  While not the most useful for actually programming, having a
definitive and consistent set of standards for organization and style can help
make your code more neat and more easily readable to others in the Chai
community.</p>

<h1>Variables</h1>
<h2>Do Blocks</h2>
<p>So far, we have only dealt with single expressions.  However, when you need to
use more complex statements or chain a series of expressions together, you need
to use a <strong>do block</strong>.  </p>
<p>Do blocks being with the keyword <code>do</code> and are wrapped by a new indentation
level.</p>
<pre><code>do
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>We can then amend our main function to use a do block instead of single
expression.</p>
<pre><code>def main() = do
    ...
</code></pre>
<p>For all the programs that follow this, we will consider our main function to
have a do block that way we can use complex statements in it.  Note that our
<code>Hello World</code> program with a do block is effectively identical.</p>
<pre><code>def main() = do
    println("Hello, world!")
</code></pre>
<p>When working with variables and assignment as we will in this chapter, do blocks
are absolutely necessary so make sure to include them.</p>
<h2>Defining Variables</h2>
<p>We use the <code>let</code> keyword in Chai to create a <strong>variable</strong>, a named location to
store a value.  Simply place the name of the variable you want to create after
the keyword followed by an <strong>initializer</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>let x = 0
</code></pre>
<p>This variable can then be used in code by name:</p>
<pre><code>let y = x + 2
</code></pre>
<p>Chai implicitly infers the type of variables based on the right-hand side. You
can explicitly specify the type using a <strong>type specifier</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>let pi: float = 3.14
</code></pre>
<p>If you include a type specifier, you don't need to provide an initializer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is only true for nullable types <em>insert link</em>.  Most of the types in Chai
(inc. all the ones we currently know) are nullable so this is rarely an issue.
Nullability is not discussed much in this guide.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>let z: string
</code></pre>
<p>You can declare multiple variables at once using commas.</p>
<pre><code>let name = "Bob", age = 50
</code></pre>
<p>You can also declare variables in an indented block.</p>
<pre><code>let
    var1 = 23
    var2 = 6.7
    var3 = 'h'
</code></pre>
<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>Variables can be <strong>assigned</strong> to which means changing their value.  We use the
<code>=</code> to assign to values in Chai.</p>
<pre><code>var1 = 42
</code></pre>
<p>You can assign to multiple variables at once. </p>
<pre><code>name, age = "Emily", 32
</code></pre>
<p>Notice that each variable on the left-hand side corresponds to the value at its
position at right-hand side.  </p>
<p>In assignment, the right side is fully evaluated before the assignment occurs.
This means that you can swap the values of two or more variables using
multi-assignment.</p>
<pre><code>x, y = y, x
</code></pre>
<p>You can only assign a value of a type that is either equal to or coercible to
the type of the variable being assigned to.  If your types do not match, you
will get an error.</p>
<pre><code>name = 45 # TYPE ERROR
</code></pre>
<p>Chai also supports many <strong>compound assignment</strong> operators.  A compound
assignment operator is an operator that performs some operation between the
variable and the value being assigned and then stores the result into the
variable.</p>
<pre><code># Expanded Form
x = x + 2

# Compound Form
x += 2
</code></pre>
<p>Those two statements are equivalent: <code>+=</code> is the compound assignment operator.
Almost all operators in Chai have compound forms.  Here are some other examples:</p>
<pre><code>let y = 5.6

y -= 1.2

y /= 2

let b = false

b &amp;&amp;= true
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, Chai also supports <strong>increment</strong> and <strong>decrement</strong> statements which add
1 or subtract 1 from a numeric value respectively.</p>
<pre><code>x++ # increment x by 1

y-- # decrement y by 1
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike what you may used to in languages like C, <code>++</code> and <code>--</code> are statements
not operators.</p>

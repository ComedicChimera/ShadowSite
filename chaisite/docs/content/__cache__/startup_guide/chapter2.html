<h2>Numeric Types</h2>
<p>Whirlwind supports two kinds of numeric types: <strong>integral</strong> types and
<strong>floating-point</strong> types.  They have the following type labels:</p>
<pre><code># Integral Types
i16   # 16-bit, signed integer
u16   # 16-bit, unsigned integer
i32   # 32-bit, signed integer
u32   # 32-bit, unsigned integer
i64   # 64-bit, signed integer
u64   # 64-bit, unsigned integer

int   # signed integer (32b on x86, 64b on x64)
uint  # unsigned integer (32b on x86, 64b on x64)
byte  # alias for `u8`

# Floating Types
f32  # 32-bit, floating-point number
f64  # 64-bit, floating-point number
</code></pre>
<div class="info">The strings of text prefixed by `#`
are comments -- text that is ignored by the compiler.</div>

<p>Here are some examples of various different numeric literals:</p>
<pre><code>45   # integer
5.6  # floating-point
5e7  # floating-point
</code></pre>
<p>All numeric types support the following basic arithmetic operations:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Operator</th>
<th>Behavior</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>+</code></td>
<td>Adds two numbers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-</code></td>
<td>Subtracts two numbers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>*</code></td>
<td>Multiplies two numbers</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>/</code></td>
<td>Divides two numbers and yields a floating-point number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>//</code></td>
<td>Divides two numbers and yields a integer number</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>%</code></td>
<td>Calculates the remainder of a division operation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>**</code></td>
<td>Raises a number to an integer power</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>All of these operators are binary: they take two numbers and return a single
value.  Note that Whirlwind supports two division operators: one that performs
floating division and one that performs integer division.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of some of the operators:</p>
<pre><code>45 + 2   # =&gt; 47
4 - .86  # =&gt; 3.14
7 % 2    # =&gt; 1
0.5 ~* 2 # =&gt; 0.25
5 / 2    # =&gt; 2.5
7 ~/ 2   # =&gt; 3
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can also use the unary <code>-</code> operator to negate a numeric value.</p>
<pre><code>-45 
-(2 - 4)
</code></pre>
<h2>String and Rune Types</h2>
<p>A <strong>string</strong> is a group of characters.  All strings in Whirlwind are UTF-8
encoded and enclosed in double quotes.  Strings have the type label <code>string</code>.  </p>
<p>A <strong>rune</strong> is a single Unicode character, represented as a 32-bit integral
value. Runes have the type label <code>rune</code> and are enclosed in single quotes.  </p>
<p>Both runes and strings support the use of escape codes.  Here are some fairly
common and/or useful ones.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Code</th>
<th>Character</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>\n</code></td>
<td>New-line</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\t</code></td>
<td>Tab</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\b</code></td>
<td>Backspace</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\\</code></td>
<td>Backslash</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\"</code></td>
<td>Escaped double quote</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>\'</code></td>
<td>Escaped single quote</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

more definitive list.</div>

<p>Both string and runes support the use of the <code>+</code> operator.  For both strings and
combinations of strings and runes, the <code>+</code> operator will concatenate (join) the
items.  However, for combinations of exclusively runes, <code>+</code> will add their
numeric values.</p>
<pre><code>"Hello" + " there" # =&gt; "Hello there"
"Yo" + '!'         # =&gt; "Yo!"
'a' + '\n'         # =&gt; 'k'
</code></pre>
<h2>Boolean Types</h2>
<p>A <strong>boolean</strong> is a true/false (Boolean) values.  There have the type label
<code>bool</code> and two literal values: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.  </p>
<p>There are two logical operators for comparing booleans: <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>.  The
former performs logical AND and the latter performs logical OR.  Booleans also
support logical NOT with the <code>!</code> operator.</p>
<pre><code>true &amp;&amp; false  # =&gt; false
true || false  # =&gt; true
false || false # =&gt; false
true &amp;&amp; true   # =&gt; true
!true          # =&gt; false
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, the numeric types support four ordinal comparison operators: <code>&gt;</code>,
<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>.  The two operators with equal signs attached translate as
<em>greater than or equal to</em> and <em>less than or equal to</em> respectively.  Here are
some examples of them:</p>
<pre><code>5 &gt; 4             # =&gt; true
8 &lt; 5.2           # =&gt; false
4 + 5 &gt;= 4 - 3.42 # =&gt; true
7 &lt;= 7            # =&gt; true
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, most types support direct comparison using the <code>==</code> and <code>!=</code> operators.
The former tests for equality and the latter tests for inequality.</p>
<pre><code>5 == 4         # =&gt; false
'a' != 'b'     # =&gt; true
"abc" == "abc" # =&gt; true
</code></pre>
<h2>Type Errors and Casting</h2>
<p>If a certain operator is applied between types for which such an application is
undefined (ie. it makes no sense), then a type error is generated.
Specifically, most operators have a small defined set of valid types of
operands.  Here are some examples of invalid combinations of operators, all of
which will generate an error at compile-time.</p>
<pre><code>5 &gt; "abc" 
!'a'
5 == "bc" # can't compare items of different types
54 &amp;&amp; 76
"name" + 7.5
</code></pre>
<p>It sometimes convenient or necessary to convert one type into another.  Some
conversions happen implicitly: from ints to floats for example.  These kinds of
conversions are called <strong>coercions</strong>.  However, some more "dangerous"
conversions such as from signed integers to unsigned integers, must be converted
explicitly using a <strong>type cast</strong>.  Type casts use the keyword <code>as</code> followed by
the type to convert to.  Here are some example casts:</p>
<pre><code>5.5 as int  # =&gt; 5
"a" as rune # =&gt; 'a'
1 as bool   # =&gt; true
</code></pre>
<p>Not all casts are valid and some will fail at compile-time or at run-time
(causing a runtime panic).  </p>

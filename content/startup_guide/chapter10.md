## What is an interface?

Much like interfaces for devices in the real world, an **interface** in Whirlwind
allows to define how we interact with certain constructs, specifically types, in
our code.  They do this by providing a set of **methods**, functions that are bound
to a specific type, that allow us to interact with that type.  

In addition to being able to define an interface for a specific type, we can also
group types based on their interface and reduce them down to a common set of behaviors.
For example, you might have two list constructs

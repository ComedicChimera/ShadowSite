## Welcome!

In this tutorial, we are going to teach you about the fundamentals
of the language.  This tutorial is designed for breadth, not depth:
to cover everything you need to know to get started and to act as
a resource for new Whirlwind developers as they get started.

This guide assumes a basic knowledge of programming -- familiarity
with the idea of a variable, function, etc. -- and some experience
using the command-line (in general).  Everything to do with the
Whirlwind toolchain that is necessary for this guide will be taught
in the next section.

## Using This Tutorial

As you read through the tutorial, we strongly encourage you to play
around with some of the example code, especially that which doesn't
make sense to you.  It is a very good idea to have a Whirlwind program
file open that you can copy and paste code into and a terminal open
to run your working file.  This should give you a space to explore
the language as you learn it and help cement your understanding of it.

Although this tutorial will help you get started, to actually learn
the language, you will need to *use* it.  As you work through the
tutorial, try making some toy programs -- more than just copying example
code -- that uses what you have learned.  When you finish with this
tutorial, try to work on a *small* project that uses Whirlwind so
you can get a sense of how the language works in a real world context
and build your "muscle memory" of the language.

## Other Resources

This guide, while helpful, is not the be all, end all of Whirlwind
programming resources.  As such, there are some other resources that
may be helpful both in learning the language and as documentation
for future use.

#### Language Specification

This is a fairly hefty and dry read, but it is the definitive resource
for all things Whirlwind: every language feature is documented and
specified here.

#### Standard Library Reference

This is hosted on Whirlwind's package index and documents all of the
standard library functions of the language.

#### Style Guide

This documents standard conventions of the language including naming,
comments, and more.  While not the most useful for actually programming,
having a definitive and consistent set of standards for organization
and style can help make your code more neat and more easily readable to
others in the Whirlwind community.

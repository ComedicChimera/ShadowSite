## Welcome!

In this tutorial, we are going to teach you about the fundamentals
of the language.  This tutorial is designed for breadth, not depth:
to cover everything you need to know to get started and to act as
a resource for new Whirlwind developers as they get started.

This guide assumes a very basic knowledge of programming and some
experience using the command-line (in general).  Everything to do
with the Whirlwind toolchain that is necessary for this guide will
be taught in the next section.

## Other Resources

This guide, while helpful, is not the be all, end all of Whirlwind
programming resources.  As such, there are some other resources that
may be helpful both in learning the language and as documentation
for future use.

#### Language Specification

This is a fairly hefty and dry read, but it is the definitive resource
for all things Whirlwind: every language feature is documented and
specified here.

#### Standard Library Reference

This is hosted on Whirlwind's package index and documents all of the
standard library functions of the language.

#### Style Guide

This documents standard conventions of the language including naming,
comments, and more.  While not the most useful for actually programming,
having a definitive and consistent set of standards for organization
and style can help make your code more neat and more easily readable to
others in the Whirlwind community.

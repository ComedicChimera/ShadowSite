# Collections

A **collection** represents a set of a related data.  They are incredibly
useful for organizing and processing data and are an integral part
of the Whirlwind language.  They are 3 kinds of collections provided
by Whirlwind: **arrays**, **lists**, and **maps**.

This is one of the few sections in which parts of the standard library
will be covered, as it contains a couple of useful tools for working
with collections.

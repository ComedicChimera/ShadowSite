# Control Flow

Programs are comprised many components. One of the biggest of those
is **control flow**.  As the name would imply, we use this concept
to help regulate how our program flows and what instructions it
evaluates.

This is accomplished through two methods: **conditionals** and **loops**.
Whirlwind provides many useful variations of each that will be covered
in this chapter.

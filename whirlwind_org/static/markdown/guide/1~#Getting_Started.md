# Getting Started
Welcome to the Whirlwind Getting Started Guide
This guide provides a comprehensive look at Whirlwind from top
to bottom.  Though this is titled a getting started guide
this guide is intended as both a tutorial and reference, and
is designed for use by programmers of all experience levels.

With all that out of the way, let's jump into Whirlwind!

***Note***: This guide will not cover installation and will only
briefly mention the standard library.  Information on each of those
topics can be found on the [Documentation](../../docs) home page.

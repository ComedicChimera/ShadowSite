## Comments

Programs can be very long and complicated.  Because of this, many languages
offer different methods for annotating your code.  In Whirlwind, this method
is called a **comment**.

Comments are completely ignored by the compiler so you can put whatever
you want in them.

There are 2 kinds of comments: **single-line** and **multi-line**.

### Single Line Comments
The first kind of comment is called a single line comment.  These begin
with two forward slashes and go until the end of the line.  You can
see an example of them in **Listing 1.3**.

**Listing 1.3** - Single Line Comments

    // i am comment
    // i only go one line
    // you can put anything in me

You will use these comment more often than you use the other kind.  They
commonly notate the purpose of one line or block.  They also tend to be
concise.

### Multi Line Comments
The second kind of comment is called a multi line comment.  They begin
with `/*` and end with `*/`.  They can span for multiple lines.
**Listing 1.4** contains an example of a multi-line comment.

    /* this
    is a
    multiline comment
    */

    /* it can span for multiple lines or only one */

These are more commonly used to give detailed explanations of large sections
of code or even entire files.  Or, they can be inserted into the middle
of a line to annotate a specific part of a line.

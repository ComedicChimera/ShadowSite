                    <h2>What Is a Suggestion?</h2>
                    <p>A suggestion is a description of an addition, removal, or altercation to Whirlwind or
                        any of its related components that would improve said component.  For example, here
                        you could suggest a language feature or perhaps an improvement to the standard library
                        or compiler.  You could even suggest an improvement to our documentation or the look of
                        the website.

                    <h2>Making a Suggestion</h2>
                    <p>When making a suggestion, keep a few things in mind.  First and foremost, you do not need to describe your
                        idea in excessive detail.  Simply give a clear enough description of your idea such that it is well 
                        understood.  Please note that while we deeply appreciate you taking the time to contribute to Whirlwind,
                        there is a probability your suggestion will either be declined or not reviewed at all.  We do try to avoid
                        the latter, but it is possible for it to occur.  If either of the above happens to your suggestion, please do
                        not take it as an indictment of you or your idea.  It may simply have been that your idea would take too much
                        time to implement or is not in line with our vision for Whirlwind.  Or simply that we did not have time to fully
                        review your suggestion.  All that being said, if your suggestion is approved, we will contact you via the email
                        you will provide to let you know that your suggestion has been approved.  Thank you again for your contribution.

                    <h2>Next Steps...</h2>
                    <p>If your suggestion is accepted, you will be contacted to alert you that your suggestion has been approved.  Your name
                        will be added to README.md of the appropriate repository, and your suggestion will be added to the suggestion bulletin
                        that can be seen under "View Accepted Suggestions".
                    </p>
                    <p>Additionally, you will be given an opportunity to submit a pull request to the appropriate repository implementing your suggestion
                        with a guarantee that it will be reviewed.  If your request is accepted, you may even be given an opportunity to push
                        code directly to the corresponding repository.  Please note that this may happen, if we deem your code contribution of
                        Whirlwind quality.  Furthermore, your permission may be revoked if it is abused and/or in violation of our code of 
                        conduct with regards to contributions.
